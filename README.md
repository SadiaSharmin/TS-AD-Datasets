# Public Datasets for Time Series Anomaly Detection

Here I summarized some datasets publicly available for time series anomaly detection.

## Yahoo Time Series Anomaly Detection Benchmark

Request access to this dataset [here](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=s&did=70).

Contains 4 folders, A1, A2, A3, A4. 

A1Benchmark is based on the real production traffic to some of the Yahoo! properties. The other 3 benchmarks are based on synthetic time-series. A2 and A3 Benchmarks include outliers, while the A4Benchmark includes change-point anomalies. The bechmarks based on real-data have property and geos removed. Fields in each data file are delimited with (",") characters.
