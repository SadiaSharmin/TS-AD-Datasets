# Public Datasets for Time Series Anomaly Detection

Here I summarized some datasets publicly available for time series anomaly detection.

## 1. Yahoo Time Series Anomaly Detection Benchmark

Request access to this dataset [here](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=s&did=70).

Contains 4 folders, A1, A2, A3, A4. 

A1Benchmark is based on the real production traffic to some of the Yahoo! properties. The other 3 benchmarks are based on synthetic time-series. A2 and A3 Benchmarks include outliers, while the A4Benchmark includes change-point anomalies. The bechmarks based on real-data have property and geos removed. Fields in each data file are delimited with (",") characters.

## 2. Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)

Description of NAB can be found [here](https://numenta.com/machine-intelligence-technology/numenta-anomaly-benchmark/).

Dataset repository is [here](https://github.com/numenta/NAB).

## 3. Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) Dataset

Multivariate time series datasets collected by “iTrust, Centre for Research in Cyber Security, Singapore University of Technology and Design”. See website [here](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/#swat) to request access to the dataset and check usage requirements.

## 4. Water Distribution (WADI) Dataset

Also collected by “iTrust, Centre for Research in Cyber Security, Singapore University of Technology and Design”. See website [here](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/#wadi) to request access to the dataset (it can actually be requested at the same time as when requesting for SWaT) and check usage requirements.
